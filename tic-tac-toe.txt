My log of what I did for tic tac toe hw.

made a template of project using npx create-react-app projname
created a github repo, and made sure my git commits were up to date - will be committing throughout proj and won't mention here for simplicity sake
cleared src/ contents and replaced with tutorial starter code
added feature where squares are rendered with their number
added feature where upon render of square the square's onClick is bound to function that changes contents inside to an X
added constructor for square class, and a states object called display that keeps track of whats in the square
added array to board class to keep track of status of whats in each square
passed onclick function for square from board to square in order to have each square class update their value in board's array
now must define the handleclcik function in board for onclick for square to work
